            <h2>Restaurant Website Design</h2>
            <p>
              I redesigned a website tailored for a high-standard restaurant
              offering exceptional meals and outstanding quality, drawing
              inspiration from a website that caught my attention.

            <h2>Glowing-Pong Game</h2>
            <p>
              Glowing Pong is a two-player arcade game where each side controls
              a paddle to prevent the ball from passing through. Use 'W' and 'S'
              for the left paddle, and the up and down arrows for the right.
              Score by outmaneuvering your opponent, simple, fast-paced, and
              neon-lit
            </p>
