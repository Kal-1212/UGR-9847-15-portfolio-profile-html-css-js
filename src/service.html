            <h2>Web Design</h2>
            <p>
              I work in crafting visually appealing and functional web designs
              tailored to align with your brand and meet user needs. My
              experience includes redesigning various websites, including the
              one highlighted above.

            <h2>Game Development</h2>
            <p>
              I have been exploring web development within Unity using a
              programming language C# and recently redeveloped a game called
              <i>Glowing Pong</i>, a two-player arcade game where each player
              controls a paddle to keep the ball from passing through. I am
              continuously learning and expanding my skills in game development
              using Unity, and I am confident that I will create more engaging
              and educational games in the future.

            <h2>Project Management</h2>
            <p>
              As a student, I have gained diverse experience in project
              management. I served as the coordinator for the Frontend
              Development course during the GDG AAU Summer Bootcamp 2024/25.
              Additionally, I am actively involved in project management
              activities at the AAiT Innovation Center and currently serve as
              the organizer of GDG AAU, where I oversee various initiatives and
              events.
